```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
df1 <- tibble(x = c(1, 2), y = 2:1, b = "b")
df2 <- tibble(x = c(1, 3), a = 10, b = "a")
```

1. Join `df1` and `df2` in such a way that the result has 1 row.

```{r}
df1 %>%
  inner_join(df2, by = "x")
```

2. Join `df1` and `df2` in such a way that the result has 2 rows.

```{r}
df1 %>%
  left_join(df2, by = "x")
```

3. Join `df1` and `df2` in such a way that the result has 2 rows.

```{r}
df1 %>%
  full_join(df2, by = "x")
```

4. Join `df3` and `df4` and explain what happens

```{r}
df3 <- tibble(x = c(1, 1, 2), y = 1:3)
df4 <- tibble(x = c(1, 1, 2), z = c("a", "b", "a"))
df3 %>%
  left_join(df4)
```
