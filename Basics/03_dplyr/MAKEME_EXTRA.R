# NOTE first convert the pop to milions, otherwise you get an error

# Show in a graph for the 10 countries with the highes pop

# Which country had the highest life expectancy in 1952?

# Plot the lifeExp over time for that country

# Show the average life expectancy per continent in a graph.

# Calculate the average life expectancy per year and per continent and
# show in a plot

# Create 3 life expectancy groups; low: lifeExp < 50, medium: lifeExp < 65
# and high: the rest. Show in a graph the size of these groups per year.

# Count the number of countries in a continent and show in a graph
