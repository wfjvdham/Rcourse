```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(nycflights13)

flights <- flights
```

Convert the following four columns from the `flights` dataset to a date-time object using `lubridate`.

1. `dep_time`
1. `arr_time`
1. `sched_dep_time`
1. `sched_arr_time`

```{r}

```

Use the results to show how many flights are leaving every day. Can you identify the difference between specific days of the week?

```{r}

```

Show when the flights left at 2 january 2013.

```{r}

```

Show the `sched_dep_time` of all the flights per minute. Are some minutes more populair for scheduling a flight?

```{r}

```

The next table show flights that have an arrival time that is before the departure time. How is this possible? Fix the error using a time period.

```{r}
#flights_dt %>% 
#  filter(arr_time < dep_time) 
```

```{r}

```
