```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
df1 <- tibble(x = c(1, 2), y = 2:1, b = "b")
df2 <- tibble(x = c(1, 3), a = 10, b = "a")
```

1. Join `df1` and `df2` in such a way that the result has 1 row.
2. Join `df1` and `df2` in such a way that the result has 2 rows.
3. Join `df1` and `df2` in such a way that the result has 3 rows.
4. Join `df1` and `df2` in such a way that the result has 4 rows.

```{r}
df3 <- tibble(x = c(1, 1, 2), y = 1:3)
df4 <- tibble(x = c(1, 1, 2), z = c("a", "b", "a"))
```

4. Join `df3` and `df4` and explain what happens
