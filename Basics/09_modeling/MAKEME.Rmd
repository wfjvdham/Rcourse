```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(corrr)
library(nycflights13)
flights <- as_tibble(flights)
```


1. Use the `corrr` package to explore the correlations in the `flight` set

```{r}

```

2. Predict the `arr_delay` using a correlated variable and measure the score of your model.

3. See if adding variables is increasing the score.
