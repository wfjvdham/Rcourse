flights <- flights %>%
  sample_n(20000)
```

1. Show the `sched_dep_time` of all the flights per minute. Are some minutes more populair for than others for scheduling a flight?
2. Group the flights based on `dep_time` and the moment of the day (morning, afternoon, evening, night). Show in a graph the relation between `air_time` and part of the day.
3. First convert both `arr_time` and `dep_time` to a `dttm`. Filter the flights that have an `arr_time` that is before `dep_time`. How is this possible? Fix the error.
