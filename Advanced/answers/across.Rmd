```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
diamonds <- as_tibble(diamonds)
flights <- flights %>%
  sample_n(20000)
```

1. Calculate the mean for all `numeric` columns in the `diamonds` dataset per `cut`

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  group_by(cut) %>%
  summarise(across(where(is.numeric), mean))
```

2. Calculate the median `x`, `y` and `z` per `depth` group. The last one you first have to create yoursef.

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  mutate(depth_group = cut(depth, 5)) %>%
  group_by(depth_group) %>%
  summarise(across(x:z, median))
```

3. Filter out the diamonds that have `x`, `y` and `z` above 7.

```{r}
diamonds %>%
  filter(across(x:z, ~.x > 7))
```

4. Filter out all the flights that have missings in any column.

```{r}
flights %>%
  filter(across(everything(), ~!is.na(.x))) %>%
  skimr::skim()
```
