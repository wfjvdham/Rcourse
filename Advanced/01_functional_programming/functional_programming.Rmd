# More questions

## Which film (see films) has the most characters?

```{r}

```

## Create the planet_lookup vector from earlier

```{r}

```

## Which species has the most possible eye colors?

```{r}

```

# For DataFrames

## Make a dataframe with: name, films, episode_ids of the films, number of films, height, species

```{r}
people_df <- data_frame(

# Put the film number in one string in one column

```{r}

# map2()

```{r}

Example of `pmap`. 

CONSIDER:

```runif(n, min = 0, max = 1)```

Want to do this for several triples of (n, min, max).
Store each triple as a row in a data frame.
Now iterate over the rows.

```{r}
df <- tribble(
  ~ n, ~ min, ~ max,
   1L,     0,     1,
   2L,    10,   100,
   3L,   100,  1000
)

# for single rows
x <- df[1, ]
runif(n = x$n, min = x$min, max = x$max)

x <- df[2, ]
runif(n = x$n, min = x$min, max = x$max)

x <- df[3, ]
runif(n = x$n, min = x$min, max = x$max)

# try with for loop

out <- vector(mode = "list", length = nrow(df))

for (i in 1:nrow(df)) {
  out[i] <- list(runif(n = df$n[i], min = df$min[i], max = df$max[i]))
}
out

# use pmap
pmap(df, runif)
```
