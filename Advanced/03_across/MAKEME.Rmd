```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
diamonds <- as_tibble(diamonds)
flights <- flights %>%
  sample_n(20000)
```

1. Calculate the mean for all `numeric` columns in the `diamonds` dataset per `cut`
2. Calculate the median `x`, `y` and `z` per `depth` group. The last one you first have to create yoursef.
3. Filter out the diamonds that have `x`, `y` and `z` above 7.
4. Filter out all the flights that have missings in any column.
