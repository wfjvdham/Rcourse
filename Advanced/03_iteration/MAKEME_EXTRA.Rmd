flights <- flights %>%
  sample_n(20000)
```

1. Calculate the mean of all columns of `iris` using a `map()`
2. Make a point plot of the `arr_delay` with the following columns:
  - `dep_time`
  - `dep_delay`
  - `air_time`
  - `distance`
  
Make sure the labels are descriptive. 

# Re-coding variables

1. Set for all the columns in the data frame all the values higher than 5 to `NA`
2. Now for only the columns 1, 2 and 3.
3. The `allowed_column_values` list contains which values are allowed for every column. Try to set all the other values of the columns to `NA`
