Look at the following (not working) code and try to understand what it should do.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
model <- glm(chemneo ~ jaar, data = df, family = binomial(link = 'logit'))
exp(confint(model))
summary(model)

model <- glm(chemneo ~ regio, data = df, family = binomial(link = 'logit'))
exp(confint(model))
summary(model)
```

1. Create an example dataframe that can be used to run this code.
1. Reduce the amount of copy-and-paste by rewriting the code.
1. Use the `broom` package to get the information from the model in a dataframe.
