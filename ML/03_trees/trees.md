Decision Trees
========================================================

- Supervised learning
- Both **Regression** and **Classification**
- Devise the data in groups using a **top-down**, **greedy** method
- Make the same prediction for every group, using the mean or the most occurred value of the group

In R:

* `party::ctree()`
* `caret::train(..., method = "rpart")`

Simple Example Tree
========================================================

Over-fitted Tree
========================================================

Pruning
========================================================

1. First train a large tree that only stops splitting when the groups are smaller than a threshold.
1. Like with Lasso, introduce a penalty for the number of leaves a tree has.
1. Use Cross-Validation to get the best value for this parameter.
1. Pick the tree for the best value of the parameter.

**This is all done by R!**

Regression and Classification
========================================================

- For regression trees the **$RSS$** is used to calculate the best split
- For classification trees the **Gini index** is used

Gini Index
========================================================

> Total variance across the different classes

Gini Index - Example
========================================================

If the Gini value is small the node is more *pure*


```r
0.5 * (1 - 0.5) + 0.5 * (1 - 0.5)
```

```
[1] 0.5
```

```r
0.2 * (1 - 0.2) + 0.8 * (1 - 0.8)
```

```
[1] 0.32
```

**This is all done by R!**

Trees vs Linear Models
========================================================

- Easy to explain in a graphical way to people
- Less predictive than linear models, only when the data is very non-linear
- Not robust, small changes in the data can result in big changes in the tree

The last point can be improved a lot by using...

Random Forest
========================================================

- Combination of many imperfect Decision Trees
- Bagging is used to create a random training set for every tree
- For every split only a random subset of $m â‰ˆ \sqrt{p}$ variables is available, this to have a bigger variance between trees

In R: `randomForest::randomForest()`

Out-of-Bag Error Estimation
========================================================


```r
# Bagging ~ 66% of the data is used
sample(1:10, replace = TRUE)
```

```
 [1]  9  5  9  6 10  7  6 10  2  9
```

The data not used, *Out-of-Bag* can be used for validation

Results are close to Cross-Validation but computationally less expensive

Regression and Classification
========================================================

- **Regression** average the predicted responses
- **Classification** take a majority vote

Examples
========================================================

Examples can be found in the `trees.R` file.

Exercise
========================================================

Train a decision tree and a random forest to predict the arrival delay using the `flights` data. Use the same steps as in the example:

1. Divide the data in a `train` and a `test` set
1. Train your model on the `train` set
1. evaluate the performance on the `test` set

**NOTE** for the random forest use a small `train` set otherwise it will take a long time
