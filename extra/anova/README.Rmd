- Method for comparing the mean between different groups
- Compensates for many pairwise comparisons

**H<sub>0</sub>**: Null hypothesis. All the means of the groups are equal.

**H<sub>A</sub>**: Alternative hypothesis. At least one mean is different.

# Conditions

1. Observations are independent within and across groups
1. Data within each group are nearly normal
1. Variability across the groups is about equal

# F - test

- F value is **mean square between groups** / **mean square error**
- F should be around 1 when there is no effect
- Using the F-distribution and two degree of freedom values the p-value can be calculated
  - df<sub>1</sub> = nr_groups - 1
  - df<sub>2</sub> = nr_data_points - nr_groups

# Example

```{r}
library(modelr)
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(sim1) + 
  geom_point(aes(x, y))
sim1_mod <- lm(y ~ x, data = sim1)
anova(sim1_mod)
```
