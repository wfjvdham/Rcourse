For joining data frames you can use the `merge()` function of the join functions from the `dplyr` package. The last ones have the following advantages^[See [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/manipulatr/OuAPC4VyfIc)] above the `merge()` function:

* rows are kept in existing order
* much faster
* tells you what keys you’re merging by (if you don’t supply)
* also work with database tables.

Good examples can be found [here](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/two-table.html)
