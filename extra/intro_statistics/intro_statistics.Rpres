Type of Variables
========================================================

![Type of variables](./variable_types.jpg)

Mean
========================================================

> The sample mean of a numerical variable is the sum of all of the observations
divided by the number of observations:

![Type of variables](./mean.jpg)

Mean - R
========================================================

```{r, results='hide'}
data_1 <- c(3, 5, 8, 9, 600)
data_2 <- c(60, 3, 5, 9, 8)
data_3 <- c(3, 4, 5, 90)
mean(data_1)
mean(data_2)
mean(data_3)
```

Variance
========================================================

> The variance is roughly the average squared distance from the mean. The standard
deviation is the square root of the variance and describes how close the data are
to the mean.

Variance - R
========================================================

```{r, results='hide'}
var(data_1)
var(data_2)

sd(data_1)

var(data_1) == sd(data_1)^2
```

Median
========================================================

> If the data are ordered from smallest to largest, the median is the observation
right in the middle. If there are an even number of observations, there will be two
values in the middle, and the median is taken as their average.

Median - R
========================================================

```{r, results='hide'}
median(data_1)
median(data_2)
```

The median is less sensitive to outliers than the mean.

Random Numbers - Discrete
========================================================

- Flipping a coin
- Throwing a dice

```{r, results='hide'}
# seed
set.seed(5)

sample(1:10, 2)
#sample(1:10, 20)
sample(1:10, 20, replace =TRUE)
```

Random Numbers - Continuous
========================================================

- Weight
- Height
- Temperature

```{r, results='hide'}
runif(10)
runif(10, 5.0, 7.5)
```

Example - Dice
========================================================

- Throwing a normal dice 1000 times
- Throwing a 10-sided dice 1000 times

```{r, results='hide'}
dice <- sample(1:6, 1000, replace = TRUE)
mean(dice)
sd(dice)

dice_10 <- sample(1:10, 1000, replace = TRUE)
mean(dice_10)
sd(dice_10)
```

Data from an Experiment
========================================================

Research question:

> Is a specific treatment working?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
results <- data_frame(
  cat = c("control", "treatment"),
  success = c(56, 41),
  failure = c(19, 34)
)
results
```

Point Estimate
========================================================

```{r}
# ratio of success for control group
p_success_control <- 19 / (19 + 56)
# ratio of success for treatment group
p_success_treatment <- 34 / (34 + 41)
# difference in success rates
(34 / (34 + 41)) - (19 / (19 + 56))
```

Hypothesis
========================================================

**H<sub>0</sub>**: Null hypothesis. The outcome is **not** dependent on the treatment.

**H<sub>A</sub>**: Alternative hypothesis. The outcome is dependent on the treatment.

Simulation
========================================================

```{r}
simulated_point_estimates <- 
  data_frame(value = seq(1:100)) %>%
  mutate(value = 1:100 %>%
    map_dbl(function(i) {
      success_rate_treatment <- sum(
        runif(75) > 0.5
      ) / 75
      success_rate_control <- sum(
        runif(75) > 0.5
      ) / 75
      success_rate_treatment - success_rate_control
    }))
mean(simulated_point_estimates$value)
```

Distribution
========================================================

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(simulated_point_estimates) +
  geom_histogram(aes(value), bins = 50) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = -0.2) +
  labs(title = "Difference in success rates")
```

***

**Conclusion:** 

The probability that the point estimate (20%) was found due to chance is smaller than 5% so we reject the **H<sub>0</sub>** and accept the **H<sub>A</sub>**

p-value
========================================================

> The **p-value** is the probability of observing data at least as favorable to the alter
native hypothesis as our current data set, if the null hypothesis were true.

**p-value** lower than 0.05 means in general the result is statistically significant

Why 0.05? [A lady tasting tea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_tasting_tea)

Type of Errors
========================================================

| | do not reject H<sub>0</sub> | reject H<sub>0</sub> in favor of H<sub>A</sub> |
| --- | --- | --- |
| H<sub>0</sub> true | okay | Type 1 Error |
| H<sub>A</sub> true | Type 2 Error | okay |

The significance level selected for a test should reflect the real-world consequences
associated with making a Type 1 or Type 2 Error.

Central Limit Theorem
========================================================

> If we look at a proportion (or difference in proportions) and the scenario satisfies
certain conditions, then the sample proportion (or difference in proportions) will
appear to follow a bell-shaped curve called the normal distribution.

**Conditions:**
- Observations in the sample are independent
- The sample is large enough

Normal Distribution
========================================================

![normal_distribution](./Empirical_Rule.PNG)

Normal Distribution - R
========================================================

```{r}
dnorm(0, mean = 1, sd = 1)
pnorm(1, mean = 0, sd = 1)
rnorm(1, 0, 1)
```

Normal Distribution - R plots
========================================================

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x <- seq(-10, 10, by = .1)

ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x, dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1)), color = "red") +
  geom_point(aes(x, dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 4)), color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Normal distributions with two different sd using dnorm()")
```

***

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x, pnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1)), color = "red") +
  geom_point(aes(x, pnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 4)), color = "blue")  +
  labs(title = "Cumulative normal distributions with two different sd using dnorm()")
```

Z - score
========================================================

$Z = \frac{x − μ}{σ}$

> The Z score of an observation is the number of standard deviations it falls above
or below the mean. We compute the Z score for an observation x that follows a
distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ

Z score in a hypothesis test
========================================================

In the context of a hypothesis test, the Z score for a point estimate is

$Z = \frac{point estimate − null value}{SE}$

The standard error in this case is the equivalent of the standard deviation of the
point estimate, and the null value comes from the null hypothesis.

Standard Deviation vs Standard Error
========================================================

*Standard Deviation* 

- Tells you how close the data is to the mean
- When the sample size increases converse to a value that is usually not 0

*Standard Error*

- Tells you how good the estimate is of something
- When the sample size increases converses to 0

Conditions for Applying the Normal Distribution
========================================================

1. Observations are Independent
  - **Experiment:** Randomly assigned to a group and no contact between groups
  - **Sample:** Less than 10% of the population
1. At least 10 successes and 10 failures in our sample

Calculate the Standard Error
========================================================

$SE_{p_1-p_2} = \sqrt{\frac{p_1(1-p_1)}{n_1}+\frac{p_2(1-p_2)}{n_2}}$

```{r}
SE <- sqrt(
  (p_success_control * 
     (1 - p_success_control)) 
  / 75 + 
  (p_success_treatment * 
     (1 - p_success_treatment)) 
  / 75
)
SE
```

Calculate the Z-score
========================================================

$Z = \frac{point estimate − null value}{SE}$

```{r}
Z <- (0.2 - 0) / SE
Z
```

Calculate the p-value
========================================================

```{r}
p <- (1 - pnorm(Z, mean = 0, sd = 1)) * 2
p
p < 0.05
```

Prediction vs Inference
========================================================

**Inference** You are interested what the relation is between the variables and how the *outcome variable* is influenced by the *input variables*. (linear model, decision tree)

**Prediction** You are only interested in predicting the *outcome variable*. How this depends on the *input variables* can be a black box. (random forest, neural networks)

**Note** Flexible models are more difficult to interpret. They can be better in predicting but only when they do not overfit the data. 

The Bias-Variance Trade-Off
========================================================

**Variance** Error in the model because of the data used for training the model. This is higher for flexible models because they follow the data more closely.

**Bias** Using a model that is much simpler than the actual relationship. This is higher for simple and inflexible methods.

Note
========================================================

This information is enough to continue. Now some more advanced topics are explained.

Confidence Intervals
========================================================

For a 95% confidence interval:

$point estimate ± 1.96 × SE$

Because:

```{r}
pnorm(1.96, 0, 1) - pnorm(-1.96, 0, 1)
```

Confidence Intervals
========================================================

```{r}
(p_success_treatment - p_success_control) - 1.96 * SE
(p_success_treatment - p_success_control) + 1.96 * SE
```

0 is not part of this confidence interval, which is consistent with our previous findings

t distribution
========================================================

> *t* distribution is similar to the normal distribution but with thicker tails. Therefore the *t* distribution works better for small (<30) sample sizes. Or when the distribution is moderately skewed

In stead of calculating a Z score based on the normal distribution you calculate a T score based on the *t* distribution. Conceptually they are the same.

Example - Game
========================================================

Two players play a game.

- Player A won 15 times.
- Player B won 10 times.

Is player A better than player B?

Hypotheses - Game
========================================================

**H<sub>0</sub>**: The quality of the players is the same.

**H<sub>A</sub>**: One of the players is better

Calculate the Standard Error - Game
========================================================

$SE_{p} = \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$

```{r}
SE <- sqrt(
  (0.5 * (1 - 0.5)) / 25
)
SE
```

Calculate the T-score
========================================================

$T = \frac{point estimate − null value}{SE}$

```{r}
t <- (0.6 - 0.5) / SE
t
```

Calculate the p-value
========================================================

```{r}
df <- 25 - 1
p <- (1 - pt(t, df)) * 2
p < 0.05
p_norm <- (1 - pnorm(t)) * 2
```
